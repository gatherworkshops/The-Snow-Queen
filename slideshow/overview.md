# Presentation

The slideshow presentation is designed to be used by the Gather Workshops team during a workshop. It is published here for you to follow along or to refer back to later.

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate through the slideshow.

Slides with a link to a Dabblet challenge also have example solutions, which can be viewed by pressing the "down" arrow while on the slide.

You can jump to specific sections of the slideshow using the sidebar to the left, or the links below.

## [Foundations of the Web]({{ site.baseurl }}/presentation/#/webfoundations)
How the internet works, the mechanics of the internet, and how computers access the internet. We also briefly cover net neutrality and web standards to gain an understanding of the organisations and networks that the Internet is built upon.


## [Structure of a Web Page]({{ site.baseurl }}/presentation/#/pagestructure)
The languages used in web development and their roles in the display of web pages we see and use every day. We talk a little about what each language offers, which ones we will be learning during the day and why these are a good starting point.


## [HTML Basics]({{ site.baseurl }}/presentation/#/htmlbasics)
Learn about the differences between standard HTML tag pairs and self-closing tags. Practise nesting tags inside one another. We cover a subset of the most common text formatting tags and also learn how to include images in our web page. All HTML practice is done using interactive code snippets, with real-time visual feedback.


## [CSS Basics]({{ site.baseurl }}/presentation/#/cssbasics)
Start adding some flair to your web page using CSS. We continue using interactive code snippets to learn how to add styles to our HTML elements using the “class” attribute, and setting page-wide defaults by targeting element types directly.


## [Build and Publish]({{ site.baseurl }}/presentation/#/sitebuilder)
Follow the presenter in laying out the structure of a basic web page to learn how to work with layout elements in HTML and CSS, then fill in content according to your own interests. We cover how to make a header, main navigation, page sections, and embedding videos from YouTube.
